# Random-password-generator
A webapp used to generate passwords including numbers, symbols, lowercase and uppercase letters.
four different passwords passwords are generated at the same time with a length adjustable between 4 and 20 characters.

It is a very basic webapp I made when I was learning code by myself.
Done only in html css and vanilla js.
